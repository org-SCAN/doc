# ðŸ–¥ Server-backed

First, go to the settings:

![](<../.gitbook/assets/image (3).png>)->![](<../.gitbook/assets/image (6).png>)



Now you will have to be sure to set all the following options:

* Sending Option : Send to server
* Token server : Enter your personal API token (ask your administrator if you are not sure)
* Server address : your SCAN deployment url (with "https://")

Now you can click on Force Get to synchronize the application with the form created beforehand by your team administrator.

You can also choose to enable Auto Update if you want the application to synchronize to the server every time you start the application.

\=> With this configuration, each time you synchronize the data, they will be automatically published in the corresponding database of your SCAN server
