# ðŸ”— Relations

Another key element of SCAN is the relations between the different people created by the form.

These types of relations are diverse, and there is a default list of "common" relations that you can use.

In fact, the default list of relations is literally a SCAN list: to be more familiar with this notion and to know how to add elements to it, we invite you to read the corresponding section if you haven't already done so : [lists.md](../getting-set-up/lists.md "mention")

### Add a relation

The first way to add a relation is to go to the "Relations" tab and use the "Add relation" function.

You will then be asked to fill in the two people involved and the type of relation :

Another way, much more ergonomic, to create relations is to go through the persons directly.

Indeed, at the bottom of the page of the details of a person, you will find a section inviting you to specify another person with whom the inspected person is in relation (and to add a type to this relation) :

This section also lists all the relations in which the inspected person is registered.

You can now inspect all the relationships between people in your form :

That's it!

People and their Relations have no more secrets for you, we can now move on to the last major feature, but not the least : The relational grap.
