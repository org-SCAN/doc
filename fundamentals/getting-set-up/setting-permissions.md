# ðŸ‘¨ðŸ”§ Users

In this section you will learn how to create new users.&#x20;

### Creating a new User <a href="#creating-a-new-user" id="creating-a-new-user"></a>

You can go to the _Users_ section in _User management_. You will see the index of the different existing roles.

By clicking on _Add user_, you will arrive on this page of User creation :&#x20;

You will then have several fields to fill in:&#x20;

* The **name** of the user,&#x20;
* his **Logins** (email and password)
* his **Role** (among those by default or a created one)&#x20;

{% hint style="info" %}
The role defines the permissions associated with the user (See [roles](roles/ "mention"))
{% endhint %}

* and finally his **Team** (by default DEFAULT\_ICRC).

{% hint style="info" %}
The team refers to the unique form that users will complete to create a persona (See [inviting-members.md](inviting-members.md "mention"))
{% endhint %}

You then register your user by clicking on the Create button at the end of the page, and you can then send his logins to your colleague.&#x20;

Like any field in our application, you can edit your user at any time (to change his role for example), but also delete him.
