# ðŸ”— Adding relations

By going to the Manage Relations menu, you can add relations between persons by clicking on the "plus" button.

![](../.gitbook/assets/image.png)->![](<../.gitbook/assets/image (2).png>)



You can then fill in all the fields and click on Save :&#x20;

![](<../.gitbook/assets/image (6).png>)->![](<../.gitbook/assets/image (13).png>)

If the relationship is Bilateral (some are by default) then two relationships will be created: in both directions.

By clicking on the person, you will be able to modify the elements.&#x20;

In addition, the cloud in front of the person is red, which means that it is not synchronized with the server. It will turn green when you click on sync data.
