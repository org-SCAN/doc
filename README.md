# 👋 Welcome to SCAN

## Overview

The project consists of a relational database, allowing to store a great diversity of data. This database is combined wih an android application and a website.&#x20;

The website allows to display, in a coherent and orderly way, all the information entered in the database. It is also possible to modulate the types of fields and information that the application collects.&#x20;

These modular and dynamic forms are associated with a given team, which can contain several users with different permissions.
