# ðŸ‘‹ Welcome to SCAN

## Overview

SCAN, for : Share, Compile, ANalyse, aims to store as much information as possible in order to find missing persons. SCAN also allows the automatic construction of a relational graph on cytoscape.

The project consists of a relational database, allowing to store a great diversity of data. This database is combined wih an android application and a website.

The website allows to display, in a coherent and orderly way, all the information entered in the database. It is also possible to modulate the types of fields and information that the application collects.

These modular and dynamic forms are associated with a given team, which can contain several users with different permissions.

A possible infrastructure of our solution can therefore be represented as follows :&#x20;

In the current state, a team is associated with **exactly one** person creation form.
