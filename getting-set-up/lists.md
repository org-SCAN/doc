# ðŸ“‹ Lists

The list is a type of field pre-filled with several values.

By default there are already pre-filled lists, like the list of all countries or the most used migration routes.

Here is a look at the list of countries :

### Use a list as a field

For example, we would like to create a field for our form where the user would have to fill in the initial destination country of a person.&#x20;

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/image.png" alt=""><figcaption><p>Bottom of the F<strong>ield creation page</strong> : we choose the country list</p></figcaption></figure>

If we create a field called "Destination" and attach the list countries to it (as seen in the image above), then the user will have a dropdown in his creation form containing all the countries and will be able to select one for the value of this field :&#x20;
