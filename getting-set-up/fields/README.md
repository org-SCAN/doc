# ðŸ—ƒ Fields

Now that several of your users are associated in the same team, it is time to create the form that they will have to fill in to add data to the database. To do this, you must specify all the fields that will make up this form.

As a reminder, here is the targeted infrastructure :

## Create a new field

SCAN allows you to create new fields in your team. To do so:

1. Go to Field Management > Fields
2. Add field
3. Fill in the form and click on Add

The example below shows the creation of a list field, which will be displayed on the site and the application. This field is a descriptive value.

**Here are the details of the form:**

{% hint style="info" %}
The <mark style="color:orange;">orange</mark> **and **<mark style="color:red;">**red**</mark>** fields are particularly important and often a source of error. Pay special attention to them.**

{% hint style="info" %}
Depending on the selected datatype, contextual fields can appear
{% endhint %}

### Contextual datatype field

Depending on the selected datatype, contextual fields can appear :

* List : you must select the associated list
* 'Rangeable' types : some datatype are 'rangeable', it means, you can define a range of value instead of a specific value. If the datatype is 'rangeable' you can choose to activate or not this range by selecting the 'Add a range to this field ?' option.

{% hint style="info" %}
If the 'Add a range to this field ?' option is not displayed, it is because the datatype you have selected is not considered as rangeable.

If you think that this datatype should be considered as a rangeable one, please let us know.
{% endhint %}

Once you are satisfied with your fields, you can test the creation of a person directly in the namesake tab.
