# ðŸ—ƒ Fields

Now that several of your users are associated in the same team, it is time to create the form that they will have to fill in to add data to the database. To do this, you must specify all the fields that will make up this form.

As a reminder, here is the targeted infrastructure :

## Create a new field

SCAN allows you to create new fields in your team. To do so:

1. Go to Field Management > Fields
2. Add field
3. Fill in the form and click on Add

The example below shows the creation of a list field, which will be displayed on the site and the application. This field is a descriptive value.

**Here are the details of the form:**

{% hint style="info" %}
The <mark style="color:orange;">orange</mark> **and **<mark style="color:red;">**red**</mark>** fields are particularly important and often a source of error. Pay special attention to them.**
{% endhint %}
